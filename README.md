This project is designed to implement a car parking system using Verilog. In this project, at the entrance of the parking system, a sensor is used to detect the presence of a vehicle. Once the sensor is triggered, a password is requested to open the gate. If the entered password is correct, the gate opens to let the vehicle in, otherwise, the gate remains locked.
